  "OperationActor — one panel composition = one supervised actor run,
  expressed as a langgraph-clj StateGraph. mangallm (the contained
  intelligence node) is sealed into a single node (:advise); its proposal is
  ALWAYS routed through the PolicyGovernor (:govern) and the rollout phase
  gate (:decide) before anything commits to the SSoT. Mirrors
  `talent.operation`'s topology.

  Everything the actor depends on is injected, so each is a swap, not a
  rewrite:
    - the Store   (MemStore | DatomicStore | kotoba-server) — `store` arg
    - the Advisor (mock coscientist | future real-LLM narrator)  — :advisor opt
    - the Phase   (0→2 rollout)                                  — :phase in ctx

  One graph run = one panel composition (intake → advise → govern → decide →
  commit | hold | approval). No unbounded inner loop — each panel is
  auditable and checkpointed.

  Human-in-the-loop = real approval workflow: `interrupt-before
  #{:request-approval}` pauses the actor and hands the decision to a human
  art director. The approver resumes with `{:approval {:status :approved}}`
  (or :rejected)."
